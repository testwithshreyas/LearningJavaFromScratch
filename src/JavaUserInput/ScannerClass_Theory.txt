The Scanner class is used to get user input, and it is found in the java.util package.

To use the Scanner class, create an object of the class and use any of the available methods found in the Scanner class documentation.

Input Types:

Method	                    Description
nextBoolean()	   Reads a boolean value from the user
nextByte()	       Reads a byte value from the user
nextDouble()	   Reads a double value from the user
