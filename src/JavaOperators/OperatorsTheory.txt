Java Operators:
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Java divides the operators into the following groups:
Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Bitwise operators

Arithmetic Operators:
Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

Operator	  Name	                 Description	                   Example
+	        Addition	      Adds together two values	                x + y
-	        Subtraction	      Subtracts one value from another	        x - y
*	        Multiplication	  Multiplies two values	                    x * y
/	        Division	      Divides one value by another	            x / y
%	        Modulus	          Returns the division remainder	        x % y
++	        Increment	      Increases the value of a variable by 1	 ++x
--	        Decrement	      Decreases the value of a variable by 1	 --x

Assignment Operators:
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

Operator	Example	       Same As
=	         x = 5	        x = 5
+=	        x += 3	       x = x + 3
-=	        x -= 3	       x = x - 3
*=	        x *= 3	       x = x * 3
/=	        x /= 3	       x = x / 3
%=	        x %= 3	       x = x % 3
&=	        x &= 3	       x = x & 3
|=	        x |= 3	       x = x | 3
^=	        x ^= 3	       x = x ^ 3
>>=	        x >>= 3	       x = x >> 3
<<=	        x <<= 3	       x = x << 3


Comparison Operators:
Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables).
This is important in programming, because it helps us find answers and make decisions.
The return value of a comparison is either true or false.

A list of all comparison operators:

Operator	    Name	                Example
==	          Equal to	                x == y
!=	          Not equal	                x != y
>	          Greater than	            x > y
<	          Less than	                x < y
>=	          Greater than or equal to	x >= y
<=	          Less than or equal to	    x <= y


Logical Operators:
As with comparison operators, you can also test for true or false values with logical operators.
Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values, by combining multiple conditions.

Operator	    Name	                Description	                                            Example
&& 	        Logical and	    Returns true if both statements are true	                    x < 5 &&  x < 10
|| 	        Logical or	    Returns true if one of the statements is true	                x < 5 || x < 4
!	        Logical not	    Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true	        !(x < 5 && x < 10)


Order of Operations:
Here are some common operators, from highest to lowest priority.

() - Parentheses
*, /, % - Multiplication, Division, Modulus
+, - - Addition, Subtraction
>, <, >=, <= - Comparison
==, != - Equality
&& - Logical AND
|| - Logical OR
= - Assignment
