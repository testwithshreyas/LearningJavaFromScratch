Data types are divided into two groups:

Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char.
Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes.

Primitive Data Types:

A primitive data type specifies the type of variable and the kind of values it can hold.
There are eight primitive data types in Java:

DataType	   Description
byte	    Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
short	    Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
int	        Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
long	    Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
float	    Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
double	    Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 to 16 decimal digits
boolean	    Stores true or false values
char	    Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values

Non-Primitive Data Types:

Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects.
The main differences between primitive and non-primitive data types are:

1) Primitive types in Java are predefined and built into the language, while non-primitive types are created by the programmer (except for String).
2) Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, whereas primitive types cannot.
3) Primitive types start with a lowercase letter (like int), while non-primitive types typically starts with an uppercase letter (like String).
4) Primitive types always hold a value, whereas non-primitive types can be null.
