Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.

Syntax:
if (condition1) {
  // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}

Think of it like real life: If it rains, bring an umbrella. Else if it's sunny, wear sunglasses. Else, just go outside normally.

Example
int weather = 2; // 1 = raining, 2 = sunny, 3 = cloudy

if (weather == 1) {
  System.out.println("Bring an umbrella.");
} else if (weather == 2) {
  System.out.println("Wear sunglasses.");
} else {
  System.out.println("Just go outside normally.");
}
// Outputs "Wear sunglasses."
