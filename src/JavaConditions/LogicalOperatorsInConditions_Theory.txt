You can combine or reverse conditions using logical operators.
These work together with if, else, and else if to build more complex decisions.

&& (AND) - all conditions must be true
|| (OR) - at least one condition must be true
! (NOT) - reverses a condition (true = false, false = true)

AND (&&),
Use AND (&&) when both conditions must be true.

Example,
int a = 200;
int b = 33;
int c = 500;

if (a > b && c > a) {
  System.out.println("Both conditions are true");
}

OR (||),
Use OR (||) when at least one of the conditions can be true.

Example,
int a = 200;
int b = 33;
int c = 500;

if (a > b || a > c) {
  System.out.println("At least one condition is true");
}

NOT (!),
Use NOT (!) to reverse a condition.

Example
Test if a is not greater than b:

int a = 33;
int b = 200;

if (!(a > b)) {
  System.out.println("a is NOT greater than b");
}
