There is also a shorthand if else, which is known as the ternary operator because it consists of three operands.

It can be used to replace multiple lines of code with a single line, and is most often used to replace simple if else statements.

Syntax,
variable = (condition) ? expressionTrue :  expressionFalse;

Example,
int time = 20;
String result = (time < 18) ? "Good day." : "Good evening.";
System.out.println(result);

You can nest ternary operators to handle more than two possible outcomes, but this can make your code harder to read.

Example,
int time = 22;
String message = (time < 12) ? "Good morning."
               : (time < 18) ? "Good afternoon."
               : "Good evening.";
System.out.println(message);

Tip: Use the ternary operator for short, simple choices. For longer or more complex logic, the regular if...else is easier to read.
