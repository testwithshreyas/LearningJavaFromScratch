You can also place an if statement inside another if. This is called a nested if statement.

A nested if lets you check for a condition only if another condition is already true.

Syntax,
if (condition1) {
  // code to run if condition1 is true
  if (condition2) {
    // code to run if both condition1 and condition2 are true
  }
}

Example,
int x = 15;
int y = 25;

if (x > 10) {
  System.out.println("x is greater than 10");

  // Nested if
  if (y > 20) {
    System.out.println("y is also greater than 20");
  }
}

Notes,
You can nest as many if statements as you want, but avoid making the code too deep - it can become hard to read.
Nested if is often used together with else and else if for more complex decision-making.
