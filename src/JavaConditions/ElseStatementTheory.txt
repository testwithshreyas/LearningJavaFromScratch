The else statement lets you run a block of code when the condition in the if statement is false.

Syntax:
 if (condition) {
 // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
 }
 else {
    // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
 }

Think of it like real life: If it rains, bring an umbrella. Otherwise (else), go outside without one:
Example
boolean isRaining = false;
if (isRaining) {
  System.out.println("Bring an umbrella!");
} else {
  System.out.println("No rain today, no need for an umbrella!");
}

Notes:
else does not have a condition - it runs when the if condition is false.
Do not put a semicolon right after if (condition). That would end the statement early and make else behave unexpectedly.
